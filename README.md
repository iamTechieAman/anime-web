## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Real-time Updates**: The platform automatically updates its anime list, latest releases, and trending shows **daily and automatically** via smart web scraping and API integration.
- **🎬 Smart Video Player**: Auto-selects the best streaming source (HLS vs MP4) and bypasses CORS restrictions using a smart proxy.
- **🚀 High Performance**: Built on Next.js 15 for server-side rendering and lightning-fast page loads.
- **📱 Fully Responsive**: Optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop with a unified, touch-friendly UI.
- **🔍 Real-time Search**: Instant search results with thumbnails and dub/sub indicators.
- **🌙 Modern Design**: Premium dark mode aesthetic with glassmorphism and smooth animations.
- **💾 Auto-Save**: Remembers your "Auto Play" and "Auto Next" settings.
- **⚡ Android Native**: Built-in support for Android via **Capacitor**, featuring native back-button handling and high-performance WebView.

## 🛠️ Development Process & Automation

ToonPlayer is designed to be a "Zero Maintenance" app. Here is how it updates automatically and handles data:

### 1. 🔄 Real-time Data Syncing
Instead of relying on static site generation (SSG) which gets stale, ToonPlayer uses **Real-time API Fetching**:
- **Zero Cache Strategy**: Every request to the `popular`, `recent`, or `trending` APIs bypasses all server-side caches.
- **Scraper Pipeline**: We built custom scrapers for **Anikai** and **AllAnime** that parse the latest HTML content directly when a user visits.
- **Auto-Refresh**: The Home page includes a client-side timer that refreshes the data every **60 seconds**, ensuring users never miss a new episode release.

### 2. 🚀 The Parallel Search Engine
To minimize search lag, we implemented a parallel search pattern:
```mermaid
graph LR
    User([Search Input]) --> API[Search API]
    API --> P1[AllAnime]
    API --> P2[AniWatch]
    API --> P3[HiAnime]
    P1 & P2 & P3 --> Merge[Result Merger & De-duplicator]
    Merge --> Res([Instant Results])
```
By querying all providers simultaneously, the app's perceived speed is as fast as the single fastest provider.

### 3. Build & Deployment
- **Web**: Automatically deployed to **Vercel** on every push to `main`.
- **Mobile**: Compiled to **Android APK** using Gradle and Capacitor. We increment versioning (currently **v1.6**) for every major UI or performance overhaul.

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

ToonPlayer's UI/UX draws inspiration from leading streaming platforms:

- **[Zoro.to](https://zoro.to)**: Server toggle system, minimal dark theme, episode grid layout
- **[Netflix](https://netflix.com)**: Featured hero section, hover animations on cards
- **[Crunchyroll](https://crunchyroll.com)**: Anime-focused color palette (purple/cyan accents)
- **[Spotify](https://spotify.com)**: Glassmorphism effects on modals and overlays

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Electric Purple (`#a855f7`) - Energy and excitement
- Accent: Cyan (`#06b6d4`) - Modern tech feel
- Background: Near-Black (`#050505`) - Premium dark mode

## ⚡ Deployment Journey

We faced several challenges during development, including:
1.  **Video Playback**: Fixing "Loading Stream" issues by implementing a smart proxy for SharePoint/GDrive links.
2.  **React 19 Compatibility**: Resolving peer dependency conflicts between Next.js 15 and video libraries.
3.  **CORS**: Handling cross-origin resource sharing for third-party video sources.
4.  **Mobile Performance**: Optimizing scroll lag by reducing GPU-heavy blur effects on mobile devices.

## 🧠 Development Methodology & AI Transparency

This project was built with a focus on **educational growth and professional learning**. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was utilized strictly as a:
*   **Debugging Assistant**: To identify complex issues like dependency conflicts (React 19 vs 18) and cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) errors.
*   **Testing Partner**: To generate edge-case scenarios and verify API responses.
*   **Learning Accelerator**: To understand advanced architectural patterns in Next.js 15.

The core logic, design decisions, and architectural implementation were driven by the developer to master modern web engineering practices.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Aman Kumar**, a developer who loves building things and learning in public.

This project started as a personal challenge to understand full-stack development with Next.js, and it turned into something I'm really proud of. Along the way, I learned that debugging is 80% of coding, CORS errors are inevitable, and React 19 doesn't always play nice with older libraries 😅

When I'm not coding, I'm probably watching anime (which is why this project exists), debugging something that worked yesterday, or drinking way too much coffee.
